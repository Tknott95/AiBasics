# AiBasics
* 00->03 - no activation functions yet, just fundamentals
* 03->10 - w/ 99% w/ layers, complexity increasing as we go
* ++advanced as you ascend, around 16 is where partial dirs start
* 23++ has a model class | Complexity Increasing
* 24++ will use actual data
* bring asset script form u24 into my 24 if file






_u scripts will be implemented in 24+ alrdy yet still modular for easy logic access_
_data is prepped after you run 24_
_u<#>.py is an asset/util script always_



@TODO 
 - mnsit data after train finished. Bring logic into model.train()   
 - use real data 4 24+

```
 #!/bin/bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "$1"

ActiFuncs, Etc  In
* ReLU
* Sigmoid
* Etc...
