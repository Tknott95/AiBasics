# AiBasics
* 00->03 - no activation functions yet, just fundamentals
* 03->10 - w/ 99% w/ layers, complexity increasing as we go
* ++advanced as you ascend, around 16 is where partial dirs start
* 23++ has a model class | Complexity Increasing
* 24++ will use actual data





@TODO 
 - mnsit data after train finished. Bring logic into model.train()   
 - use real data 4 24+






##### .git.sh
```
 #!/bin/bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "$1"
  git push
```

ActiFuncs, Etc  In
* ReLU
* Sigmoid
* Etc...
