  @TITLE
    Would (I|Mock_Person) survive the titanic?
  @DOING
   Will be loading pre-made csv data, from daZ g00gle, and playing w/ it.
  @CREDS
    Will have my own tweaks so think of this as a "fork" in a way.
    From tensorflow.ord docs,original author of base code tfTeam.
    Tweaked code from: url(https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/csv)

    CSV files can contain many diff data types.
    Usually you want to convert these from mixed types to a fixed length vector prior to being fed to the model.
    tf.feature_column is a built in tf func for input conversions.
    can prepoc data w/out tf and jsut pass it in, obviously.
    Doing preproc in model allows for when you export model it includes preproc.
     This allows for passing raw data directly to model.
