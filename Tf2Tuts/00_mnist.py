      This first layer transforms the format of the imgs from a 2D array, of 28 * 28 = 784 pixels.
      "Sort of" unstacks rows of pixels in the img and lines them up.
      Layer has no params to learn, only reformats the data.
      Now that the pixels are flattened the network consists of two tf.layers.Dense layers.
      These will be densely connected, or fully connected, neural layers.
  '''
  # keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  # keras.layers.Dense(10)
  '''
      The first Dense layer has 128 nodes, or neurons. The second (and last) layer returns a logits array with length of 10.
      Each node contains a "score" that indicates the curr img belongs to one of the 10 classes.
  '''

      LossFunction â€” Measures model accuracy during training.

      Optimizer    - How the model is updated via. data it sees from loss func
      Metrics      - Monitors training & testing steps. Will use accuracy, the fraction of images correctly classified.
